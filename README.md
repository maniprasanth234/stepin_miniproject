## AIM:TO SEE THE DATE AND MONTH AS USUAL CALENDARS
## Advantages: - 
The calendar can be used for two purposes. 
First to see the date and month as usual calendar
Let’s you see all your events at a quick glance.
Makes it easy to schedule new events. You know what’s already there.
## Disadvantages: -
	It will show the full month with all of your event details visible,
  
  but because the screen is small,
  
  most will show only a dot to signify that something is listed for that day.
  
  For me, this is a disadvantage because it is difficult to look at the month as a whole and plan for deadlines.
## Future enhancements: -
Time-saving features. Enhanced aggregation pulls all of your schedules into a single interface (no more checking multiple locations) and gives you control over which calendars you aggregate. Plus, all the details from your meeting invites — location, passcodes, contacts — sync up and create actionable items right from your calendar.

Smarter design. When you’re looking at your schedule on the go, you probably don’t want to see your entire week. You need a swipe able, simple interface that helps you focus on the present. Many smart calendar apps display your schedule as a day-by-day, task-style list that’s easier to see on a smaller screen. Some even let you swipe agenda items from a locked screen, too, creating a more convenient way to stay on track on the go.
